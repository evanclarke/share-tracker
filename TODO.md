# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible) sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md), to keep this list focused on active work. When a section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see CLAUDE.md.

The sections below come from the **2026-07-13 improvement review** (a whole-project pass for
operational and test-strategy gaps, as distinct from the 2026-07-12 programming/domain review whose
findings are all closed in DONE.md), except where a section's heading names another source
(e.g. REQUIREMENTS, SCENARIOS). Each section records one finding; sections land in DONE.md as they
are fixed or decided.

## Two documentation gaps found alongside the section B pass (SCENARIOS B-17, B-20)
(SCENARIOS.md section B verification pass, 2026-08-15. Neither produces a wrong figure; both leave
a reader unable to tell what the system did.)
- [ ] B-17 — a Sell's brokerage and GST are **netted off `proceeds`** rather than added to the
  cost base: a 100-unit sale at $12 with $10.945 of costs reports `proceeds: 1189.055` /
  `cost_base: 1010.945`, where the ATO's own presentation is capital proceeds $1,200 against a cost
  base including the disposal's incidental costs (`docs/ato/cgt-cost-base.md`, second element:
  costs "that relate to the CGT event"). The capital gain is identical either way — only the two
  reported components differ — but `docs/API.md`'s realised-gains section defines neither, so a
  user reconciling against an ATO worksheet finds two figures that don't match and a gain that
  does. Document which convention the report uses, and why
- [ ] B-20 — rights **bought on-market** can be exercised only up to the holding's own record-date
  entitlement: `POST /corporate_actions/:id/exercise` caps cumulative units at the entitlement and
  answers `the units exercised exceed the entitlement earned by the holding at the record date`.
  That is a safe refusal, and the cost-base side works (`rights_cost` lands in the parcel's cost
  base and the discount clock runs from exercise, both checked) — but `rights_cost`'s documentation
  ("the total paid to acquire the exercised rights, 0 … for rights issued free") implies purchased
  rights are supported, while Known limitations names only pre-CGT originals and non-renounceable
  retail premiums. Say that rights acquired beyond the holding's own entitlement are not recordable
