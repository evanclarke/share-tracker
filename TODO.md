# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible) sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md), to keep this list focused on active work. When a section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see CLAUDE.md.

Sections here come from the **2026-07-13 improvement review** (a whole-project pass for
operational and test-strategy gaps, as distinct from the 2026-07-12 programming/domain review whose
findings are all closed in DONE.md), except where a section's heading names another source
(e.g. REQUIREMENTS, SCENARIOS). Each section records one finding; sections land in DONE.md as they
are fixed or decided.

**SCENARIOS.md sections A–V are driven and every finding they raised is closed** in the `DONE/*.md`
archive. Section **S. Settlement, holidays, and dates** was driven 2026-08-22 (`d501408`) and its
four findings closed by `67c3096` (a trade dated in the future), `30d0e96` (a trade dated on a day
its exchange was shut), `4a7ef1a` (a stored settlement date that is not a trading day) and
`e453f21` (the settlement dates a completed calendar changes) — all four archived in
[`DONE/trades-income.md`](DONE/trades-income.md), and summarised with the rest of the pass under
[Section S findings](SCENARIOS.md#section-s-findings). Every section's row in SCENARIOS.md's
[Verification status](SCENARIOS.md#verification-status) table names the pass that drove it and where
its findings went; that table is the record of what has been looked at.

Section **T. Jobs, backup, and operations** (12 scenarios) was driven on **2026-08-22** against
throwaway databases (a small one for the HTTP surface, a 265 MB one to catch a backup mid-write) and
raised **six findings**, and all six are now closed — the three jobs that recorded their failure as a
Rust `Debug` string (T-06), the startup "no schedule entry" warning that cried wolf on the two
deliberately-manual jobs (T-09/schedule), `POST /jobs/:name`'s bare-status-code failures, now
bodied 404/500 replies with an unknown query parameter refused rather than ignored (T-10), the
run interrupted by a restart that left no record and an unverified file wearing a backup's name
(T-11), now a run row opened at the start and a backup staged under `.partial` until it verifies,
the job that stops running and is never noticed (T-11/T-02/T-12), now a `job_schedule` table the
scheduler rewrites every iteration with a health `overdue_jobs` list and a **next run** column on the
Jobs screen over it, and the currency import that skipped the whole ISO 24165 half and reported an
unqualified success (T-09), now a per-feed import summary and a `job_runs.note` the Jobs screen shows
beside a still-`ok` status — all six archived in [`DONE/infra.md`](DONE/infra.md).
Everything else in the section came back correct: the
per-job lock serialises overlapping triggers (T-01), the run history bounds itself at 20 while
keeping a fail-then-succeed sequence readable (T-02), a corrupt backup is quarantined (T-03),
retention pruning over 20 backups spanning 18 months keeps exactly the newest 8 plus the first of
each of the 12 most recent months and touches nothing else in the directory (T-04), the DST-pinned
price-import entries fire at 17:30 local on both sides of every transition in both hemispheres and
handle the skipped and repeated hours exactly as the README states (T-05), the manual CSV retry
imports what the unreachable feed would have (T-06), an expiring MIC flips the validation report to
`expired` without blocking anything (T-08), and a stale price date, a stale FX month and a failed job
all surface at once and independently on the health report and its banner (T-12).

Section **U. Audit trail and history** (8 scenarios) was driven on **2026-08-22** against a
throwaway database, with two live backups read read-only to check each finding against real data.
**The trail's machinery came back correct**: every one of the 22 audited tables' triggers records
every column of the live schema (U-01, checked by diffing `PRAGMA table_info` against each trigger's
`json_object` keys, which is stronger than the name-list pin the tests carry); `row_history` is
append-only and no `REPLACE INTO` path exists anywhere in the tree, while migration 0025 — the one
migration that rewrites an audited table's data in place — deliberately drops the triggers first, so
no migration forges an entry (U-02); a cascade-deleted attachment is recorded like a directly deleted
row (U-04); a superseded manual closing price's `sourced_from`, `reason` and `origin` are fully
recoverable exactly as `docs/API.md` claims (U-06); a non-audited table is refused 422 naming the
audited list (U-07); and the report is unbounded by design, which is the safe direction for an audit
trail — 10,000 entries served in 0.42 s, against a live maximum of 2 entries on any single row
(U-08).

It raised **three findings, and all three are now closed** — the id handed out again that inherits
the deleted row's trail (U-a), which was live in the real database and took three commits: the trail
now says whose history it is (`7b915cf`), migration 0045 gives 17 audited tables `AUTOINCREMENT` ids
(`4a3a257`), and every server-created id now comes from the database rather than `MAX(id) + 1`
(`1a0f821`); the multi-row operation readable only by ids the user never saw, now a browse form over
the whole trail (`be64d3d`); and the trigger-column rule enforced only by hand-written per-migration
assertions, now a generic guard derived from the live schema (`57502eb`) — all three archived in
[`DONE/infra.md`](DONE/infra.md).

Section **V. Back-dated and out-of-order entry** (10 scenarios) was driven on **2026-08-23** against
throwaway databases and raised **five findings, all of them now closed**. Six scenarios came back
correct, and structurally so: every figure is keyed on a *date*, never on entry order or id order —
a year of trades entered in reverse changes nothing (V-01), a Sell allocated to the wrong parcel is
corrected once the forgotten Buy arrives (V-02), an AMMA statement entered before any trade is
recordable and its generation refusal names all three reasons no parcel was open (V-04), a rename
recorded after prices were collected leaves them untouched (V-05), a return of capital dated inside
a snapshotted period stales exactly the snapshots on and after it — in both directions when the date
is later moved (V-07), and a back-dated fact re-chains every later year's carried-forward loss
(V-10), whose unmarked restatement is the documented A-15 limitation rather than a new finding.

The five findings were: a misspelt request-body field dropped so the record took its default — an
AMMA statement losing A$7,142 under a `204` — now `deny_unknown_fields` on every HTTP body with a
test that walks the extractors to keep it true (`5e6246b`, archived in
[`DONE/infra.md`](DONE/infra.md)); a DRP reinvestment entered behind a later one reading its residual
forward in time, now refused as undo already was (`b08f891`) and a reinvestment into an
already-closed period bringing forward nothing, now asking the period for the split instead of a
stored column (`4b579c8`) — both archived in [`DONE/trades-income.md`](DONE/trades-income.md); the
trade entered twice that was the one duplication the health report did not look for, now a
`duplicate_trades` check keyed on a repeated broker contract note reference within a listing
(`2d9c3a8`, archived in [`DONE/reporting.md`](DONE/reporting.md)); and the parcel dated behind an
executed scrip exchange, demerge or worthless recognise that was never consumed, now refused across
all eight parcel-creating paths and reported by
[rollover consistency](SCENARIOS.md#rollover-consistency) for any database already in that state
(`fc1fd7b`, archived in [`DONE/tax-domain.md`](DONE/tax-domain.md)). All five are summarised under
[Section V findings](SCENARIOS.md#section-v-findings).

**Nothing is open in this file.**

After V, the next SCENARIOS pass is section **W. Precision, rounding, and scale** (8 scenarios),
driven the way S, T, U and V were: run every scenario against a throwaway database, apply the
standing probes to each, and log what each raises as a `## SCENARIOS W-nn` section here with the
option Evan chose. The lessons worth carrying forward are in the handover memory. V added three.
First, and again — **the standing probes find what the scenario list does not name**: three of V's
five findings came from the probes rather than the scenario they are filed under, and V-a was found
by *making the typo myself* while driving V-04, which is the strongest argument yet for driving a
scenario by hand rather than by script. Second, **a finding often has a sibling one room away**: the
project already held the rule V-a, V-c and V-d each needed — `deny_unknown_fields` on the two
non-HTTP bodies, a `duplicate_*` check on every fact table but one, a refusal for three of the four
things that can sit behind an executed rollover — so the useful question after finding a gap is
"where is this rule already applied, and what did it miss?". Third, **bound a finding with its
control before logging it**: V-e reads as a general DRP fault until the same facts are driven with
the period left open, which are correct throughout — that control is what identified the closure,
not the chain, as the cause, and it is what kept the fix from being aimed at the wrong mechanism.
