# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

This file holds only open / in-flight work. Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible)
sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md). When a
section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see
CLAUDE.md.

A section records one finding, and its heading names where it came from — a REQUIREMENTS entry, a
[SCENARIOS.md](SCENARIOS.md) section, or a dated review pass.

The last full pass recorded here — the 2026-09-17 code review — is closed and archived in
[`DONE/reviews.md`](DONE/reviews.md) (26 sections), with its summary and closing narrative in
[`DONE/verification-passes.md`](DONE/verification-passes.md). Everything before it is likewise
archived; the maintained record of what has been verified is SCENARIOS.md's
[Verification status](SCENARIOS.md#verification-status) table, and of what was built and decided,
the [DONE.md](DONE.md) index. The 2026-09-24 REST API audit — its documentation fixes, consistency fixes,
machine-client surface and API improvements — is closed and archived in
[`DONE/api.md`](DONE/api.md), which is the record of what it found and what
answered each finding.

The nine items the 2026-09-26 per-commit review deliberately left — the structural
enforcement it judged out of proportion, and the three decisions it would not make on the
owner's behalf — are closed too, and archived with the review itself in
[`DONE/reviews.md`](DONE/reviews.md).

The 2026-10-04 HTTP API consistency sweep — cross-site write and DNS-rebinding guard, strict lists,
one path casing, readable writable URLs, one rejection shape, and the `200`/`201` rule — is closed
and archived in [`DONE/api.md`](DONE/api.md), and so is the 2026-10-04 agent-usability pass that
followed it (OpenAPI bodies, ids, descriptions and slices, `?dry_run=true`, the live-API skill,
trustworthy `required` lists, and reasoned GET-one `404`s). The one open section below came from the
2026-10-08 sweep of the ATO mirrors (`docs/ato/OVERVIEW.md`, *Full sweep, 2026-10-08*).

## 2026–27 Budget CGT changes — announced, not law (ATO mirror sweep 2026-10-08)
The ATO's CGT discount, cost base, how-to-calculate and indexation pages have carried a banner
since 29 June 2026: "Recent changes to capital gains tax (CGT) announced in the 2026–27 Federal
Budget don't apply to Tax Time 2026", with "Resources will be available at a later date". As
reported (not yet ATO guidance), the measure replaces the 50% discount with **cost-base indexation
plus a 30% minimum tax** on real gains for assets held 12 months or more, from **1 July 2027**,
with an asset bought before and sold after that date taxed under the existing rules for the gain
accrued to 1 July 2027 and the new rules after it. Nothing is modelled or mirrored yet: there is
no legislation or ATO guidance to implement against, and every disposal this system can hold today
falls under the existing rules.
- [ ] Watch: when the measure is legislated and the ATO publishes guidance, mirror it into
  `docs/ato/` and index it in `docs/ato/OVERVIEW.md` (re-fetch the four bannered pages then too)
- [ ] NEEDS DECISION (owner), once the rules are known: whether and how to model the 1 July 2027
  split. Known shape of the inputs: a per-parcel **market value at 1 July 2027** to divide the gain
  (the closing-price table is the natural source); a CPI series that runs past September 1999
  (`cpi_quarters` is frozen at the 1999 freeze today); and the 30% minimum tax, which turns on the
  taxpayer's marginal rate — outside the data model, like the FITO offset limit
- [ ] Whatever is decided, make sure a closing price is stored for every held listing on the last
  trading day before 1 July 2027 (the scheduled price import plus `closing_price`'s held-days
  backfill), since a missing one cannot be fetched reliably years later
