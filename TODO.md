# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible) sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md), to keep this list focused on active work. When a section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see CLAUDE.md.

The sections below come from the **2026-07-13 improvement review** (a whole-project pass for
operational and test-strategy gaps, as distinct from the 2026-07-12 programming/domain review whose
findings are all closed in DONE.md), except where a section's heading names another source
(e.g. REQUIREMENTS). Each section records one finding; sections land in DONE.md as they are fixed
or decided.

## Editing a split/bonus/return-of-capital in place restates the same figures a delete now can't
(Found closing *Deleting a split/bonus/return-of-capital silently restates reported gains* — now in
[DONE/reviews.md](DONE/reviews.md) — 2026-08-14. `PUT /corporate_actions/:id` re-checks only the
`trades.*_action_id` references (`WriteError::ReferencedByTrade`), so for the three read-time
action types an edit is unguarded: changing a `ShareSplit`'s ratio from 2:1 to 1:1, or moving its
`date` past a Sell, restates every quantity, cost base, and realised gain computed from it — the
same A-20 state the new delete guard refuses, reached one verb over. Documented as a Known
limitation rather than left silent, because the correction path is worth keeping: the blanket freeze
would mean deleting years of trades to fix a typo.)
- [ ] Decide the shape. A blanket freeze is wrong (it closes the only way to fix a mis-keyed
  ratio). Candidates: refuse only the *breaking* edits — a ratio change, or a `date` move — while
  dependent trades exist, leaving a same-terms correction free; or accept the edit but validate the
  resulting state (re-run the affected Sells' allocation checks inside the write transaction and
  refuse `422` if any would now over-consume its parcel), which is stricter and needs no rule about
  which fields matter
- [ ] Whichever way: an edit must not be able to leave allocations exceeding a parcel, the same
  invariant the delete guard now upholds
- [ ] Tests: `entities::corporate_action::tests` — the A-20 shape reached by `PUT` is refused, and
  a correction that breaks nothing still lands
- [ ] Docs sync: `docs/API.md` Corporate actions + Response codes 422, and retire the Known
  limitations entry (`Editing a split, bonus issue, or return of capital in place restates prior
  figures`) plus its `doc_checks` assertions if the edit stops being possible

## A DELETE blocked by an inbound foreign key says the row does not exist (SCENARIOS A-18, A-23, A-38, A-41)
(SCENARIOS.md section A verification pass, 2026-08-14. `ApiError`'s `From<sqlx::Error>` maps
`ErrorKind::ForeignKeyViolation` to `"the request refers to a record that does not exist"`
(`src/infra/http.rs:295`) — correct for an *outgoing* FK (a write naming an unknown listing or
currency), but the same SQLite error kind covers the *incoming* case, where a DELETE is blocked
because something still references the row. `delete_handler`'s own doc comment (`src/infra/http.rs:266`)
records that this is the path such deletes take. For a delete the message states the opposite of
the truth: the row exists, and what is missing is the name of whatever depends on it. It also
breaks the error-bodies contract in `docs/API.md` ("saying *why* it failed — the failed invariant").)
- [ ] Reproduced on every entity whose delete has no hand-written guard: `DELETE
  /amma_statements/:id` with generated AMIT adjustments (A-18/A-19 — and the statement is
  undeletable until they are removed one by one, which the message never says), `DELETE
  /listings/:id` with stored closing prices (A-23), `DELETE /exchanges/:mic` referenced by a listing
  or its own holidays (A-41), and `DELETE /corporate_actions/:id` frozen by its trade group (A-38 —
  `docs/API.md` promises a `422` here, and the status is right, only the reason is wrong)
- [ ] Fix shape: keep the outgoing wording for writes, and give deletes a message that names the
  dependant — either by parsing the constraint's table out of the SQLite detail (it names the child
  table) or by adding hand-written guards like `trade`'s and `holding_account`'s. Entities with an
  explicit guard already answer well ("this account still has trades, income, AMMA statements …")
- [ ] A-23 follow-on to document either way: a listing that has ever had a **manual** closing price
  entered can never be deleted — the manual price is `status: ok`, so `DELETE /closing_prices/…`
  refuses it (the documented one-way rule), and the listing's FK refuses while it stands. That
  dead-end is a consequence of two documented rules but is not itself stated anywhere
- [ ] Tests: `infra::http::tests` (or per-entity) — a delete blocked by a dependant answers `422`
  naming the dependant, and a write naming an unknown row keeps the existing wording
- [ ] Docs sync: `docs/API.md` Response codes `422` row + the AMMA statements and Listings sections
  (what blocks a delete and how to clear it)

## Deleting a DRP enrolment period strands its trailing residual (SCENARIOS A-43)
(SCENARIOS.md section A verification pass, 2026-08-14. Closing a period by setting
`unenrolment_date` settles the trailing residual — the leftover the period's last reinvestment
carried forward moves to `residual_paid_out` on that DRP trade, in the same transaction, because the
registry refunds it at termination (`db_unenrolment_pays_out_trailing_carried_residual` pins this).
`DELETE /drp_enrolments/:id` ends the period just as finally and does none of it.)
- [ ] Reproduced: enrol open-ended, reinvest $100 at $10.50 → DRP trade with
  `residual_carried_forward: 5.5`, `residual_paid_out: 0`. Unenrolling → `carried 0 / paid_out 5.5`.
  Deleting the period instead → `carried 5.5 / paid_out 0` — cash recorded as carrying forward into
  a period that no longer exists, and nothing can pick it up (a later reinvestment is refused
  outright, `"account 'Default' is not enrolled …"`)
- [ ] Decide: settle the trailing residual on delete the same way unenrolment does, or refuse the
  delete while the period covers a reinvestment (pointing at unenrolment instead). The second is
  probably right — deleting a period that already produced DRP trades erases the record of why they
  exist, and the reinvestment cannot be re-created afterwards
- [ ] Tests: `entities::drp_enrolment::tests`, mirroring
  `db_unenrolment_pays_out_trailing_carried_residual` for the delete path
- [ ] Docs sync: `docs/API.md` DRP enrolments (what deleting a period does to a trailing residual)

## A closed financial year can be restated with nothing marking it (SCENARIOS A-15, A-21, A-25, A-35)
(SCENARIOS.md section A verification pass, 2026-08-14. Every tax report is computed live from the
current facts, so editing a prior year's inputs silently changes figures that may already have been
lodged. Report snapshots do not cover this — they snapshot the three price-dependent reports only,
never the tax summary, net capital gain, or annual tax report. `row_history` records the change, so
the restatement is *auditable* after the fact, but nothing *surfaces* it.)
- [ ] Reproduced four ways, all `204`/`200` with no flag: changing a lodged year's Buy price
  (FY2023 net capital gain $500 → $1,100, A-15); deleting a `ReturnOfCapital` after its G1 gain was
  reported (A-21 — that *delete* is now refused `422`, see DONE/reviews.md; editing the payment
  amount in place restates the same year, so the finding stands); deleting the `cgt_settings`
  opening carried-forward loss after later years
  consumed it (FY2024 net gain $500 → $1,000, A-25); deleting the only disposal of a loss year that
  a later year's carry-forward drew on (FY2024 net gain $750 → $1,500, A-35). The annual tax report
  keeps reporting `completeness.complete: true` throughout
- [ ] Decide the scope: this may be honest "not modelled" — there is no lodged/closed-year concept
  in the data model, and adding one is a real feature (a lodgement marker per FY, plus a
  "changed since lodgement" flag driven off `row_history` timestamps). If it stays unmodelled it
  needs a **Known limitations** entry saying so plainly, since a user reasonably assumes a prior
  year's numbers are settled. Either way this is a documentation-or-feature decision, not a bug
- [ ] Related, low severity (A-40): `DELETE /exchange_holidays/:mic/:date` has no guard and no flag,
  and a trade re-saved afterwards without an explicit `settlement_date` silently recomputes against
  the changed calendar (reproduced: an ASX trade settling 2024-04-02 recomputed to 2024-03-29 — Good
  Friday itself — once that holiday was deleted). Stored `settlement_date` values are untouched, and
  no CGT figure reads the column (only the settlement-coverage report and the annual tax report's
  display do), so the exposure is a record field, not a tax figure. Worth one line wherever the
  restatement decision above lands
