# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible) sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md), to keep this list focused on active work. When a section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see CLAUDE.md.

The sections below come from the **2026-07-13 improvement review** (a whole-project pass for
operational and test-strategy gaps, as distinct from the 2026-07-12 programming/domain review whose
findings are all closed in DONE.md), except where a section's heading names another source
(e.g. REQUIREMENTS). Each section records one finding; sections land in DONE.md as they are fixed
or decided.

## Authentication if ever exposed beyond localhost (honourable mention)
Currently handled correctly: the server binds `127.0.0.1` by default and exposing it is an explicit
`--host` opt-in documented as unauthenticated. Only matters if the server is ever exposed.
- [ ] If/when exposure is wanted: add an auth layer (e.g. a bearer token/basic-auth middleware over the whole router) before recommending `--host 0.0.0.0` for anything but a trusted LAN; until then this section records the decision that localhost-only is the accepted posture

## 37 error enums with hand-written `From<sqlx::Error>` (2026-07-29 Rust review)

There are 37 error enums and 32 hand-written `impl From<sqlx::Error>` blocks that all read
`fn from(e: sqlx::Error) -> Self { X::Db(e) }`. None of them implement `Display` or
`std::error::Error`, so when one is wrapped into `ApiError::Internal` the log message quality
depends entirely on whatever the `From<EntityError> for ApiError` arm writes, and the underlying
error's `source()` chain is lost.

`thiserror` gives `#[from]`, `Display`, and `source()` chaining for free. It is a proc-macro-only
dependency (no runtime surface) with a clean advisory history, so it passes the `cargo deny check
advisories` gate.

- [ ] Add `thiserror` and convert the 37 enums: `#[derive(thiserror::Error, Debug)]` with `#[error("…")]` per variant and `#[from]` on the `Db(sqlx::Error)` variant, deleting the 32 `From<sqlx::Error>` impls
- [ ] Keep every `impl From<EntityError> for ApiError` exactly as it is — those carry the user-facing 422 wording that `docs/API.md` documents and must not become derived `Display` output
- [ ] Tests: the existing per-entity rejection tests already assert the 422 bodies, so a green suite is the gate that the user-facing messages are unchanged. Add one test asserting a wrapped `sqlx::Error` still reaches the log through `ApiError::Internal` with its own message intact (extending `infra::http::tests::internal_logs_the_wrapped_error_at_error_level`)

## Over-long functions (2026-07-29 Rust review)

23 functions exceed 100 lines in the non-test build (`cargo clippy -- -W clippy::too_many_lines`).
The tail is what matters:

| lines | function |
| --- | --- |
| 362 | `reports/activity.rs:128` |
| 327 | `reports/tax_report.rs:693` |
| 249 | `entities/transfer.rs:208` |
| 249 | `entities/demerger.rs:130` |
| 234 | `entities/scrip_exchange.rs:126` |
| 212 | `reports/tax_summary.rs:342` |
| 206 | `reports/realised_gains.rs:358` |

The three entity ones are all the same shape — validate → walk parcels → build replacement rows →
write, in one transaction — and split naturally along those seams. The open-parcel and `Money`
sections will already shrink several of these, so this is deliberately sequenced last. (The
open-parcel extraction has since landed — see DONE/reviews.md — taking the count from 23 to 22;
none of the tail entries below moved, so the table still stands.)

- [ ] Split `reports/activity.rs:128` (362 lines) — the largest single function in the codebase; treat as its own task
- [ ] Split `reports/tax_report.rs:693` (327 lines)
- [ ] Split the three rollover/transfer operations (`transfer.rs:208`, `demerger.rs:130`, `scrip_exchange.rs:126`) along the shared validate → walk → build → write seam, ideally sharing the extracted pieces rather than each growing its own
- [ ] Re-measure after the open-parcel and `Money` refactors land and record here which of the remaining sub-250-line entries are actually worth splitting — a long function that is one flat, well-commented sequence is not automatically a defect
- [ ] Tests: pure refactor, so the gate is the existing suite plus `ato_examples.rs` passing unchanged; no behaviour change means no new test, which is the one case where an item here closes without one

## HTTP test boilerplate (2026-07-29 Rust review)

`test_support.rs` solved the *data* half of test setup (builders for the wide structs) but not the
HTTP half: 274 `Request::builder()` calls across 55 files and 130 copies of
`.collect().await.unwrap().to_bytes()`. Only `entities/closing_price.rs` has local `post_json`
/`put_json` helpers (`:2314`, `:2424`); every other module open-codes the request and the body
decode. Since tests are ~60% of the tree (41.6k of 69.8k lines), this is where line-count reduction
is largest — but it is lower value than the sections above, so it should not jump the queue.

- [ ] Add the HTTP half to `test_support.rs`: an `ApiClient` wrapping `app::router(pool, registry, fetcher)` (or the narrower `router().with_state(pool)` where a test doesn't need the registry/fetcher) with `get_json::<T>(path)`, `put_json(path, &body) -> StatusCode`, `post_json::<T>(path, &body)`, and a `status_and_body(path)` for the rejection tests that assert on the 422 text
- [ ] Migrate test modules onto it opportunistically — when a module is already being touched for one of the sections above, rather than as one large mechanical commit
- [ ] Tests: the migrated tests are the test; the gate is the full suite passing unchanged after each module's migration
