# TODO

Items are only marked done when a passing test exists for them.

Completed and decided (out-of-scope / not-reproducible) sections are archived in the topical `DONE/*.md` files, indexed by [DONE.md](DONE.md), to keep this list focused on active work. When a section here is fully done, move it into the matching `DONE/*.md` file rather than leaving it — see CLAUDE.md.

Sections here come from the **2026-07-13 improvement review** (a whole-project pass for
operational and test-strategy gaps, as distinct from the 2026-07-12 programming/domain review whose
findings are all closed in DONE.md), except where a section's heading names another source
(e.g. REQUIREMENTS, SCENARIOS). Each section records one finding; sections land in DONE.md as they
are fixed or decided.

**SCENARIOS.md sections A–P are driven and every finding they raised is closed** in the `DONE/*.md`
archive. Section **Q. Prices, valuation, and snapshots** was driven 2026-08-20: ten of its fifteen
scenarios came back correct outright — Q-01 (a provider gap on a real trading day is stored as an
errored row, blocks that date's snapshot with the error text quoted back, and is surfaced by
`GET /reports/health`'s `errored_prices`), Q-03/Q-04 (a hand-entered price is one-way exactly as
documented: `POST /closing_prices/fetch` refuses it 422 quoting the row's own `reason`, a backfill
counts it `already_stored`, and the validation refuses a non-trading day, a close that is not final,
a blank `sourced_from`/`reason` and a non-positive price), Q-06 (a date blocked by two missing prices
reports both blockers, then one, then generates — and the `report-snapshot` job's 14-day window
leaves an older date alone, which `regenerate_all` reaches with `regenerate_range` widening its
default `from` to the first-ever-held date), Q-07 (a back-dated Buy triggers no price backfill and
shows up as `unpriced_days` in health, as documented), Q-08 (**every** fact write stales the right
dates — trade insert, parcel allocation via a Sell, income, AMMA statement by its
`tax_year_end_date`, corporate action, a manual price replacing another, an
`rba_fx_rates` correction from the first of its month, and the `listings` `amit` flip — bar the one
table that was missing, `exchange_holidays`, since given its own trigger set by migration 0033),
Q-10/Q-11 (period performance refuses `from == to` and `from > to` with the same message, and names
the endpoint date it has no stored price for), Q-12/Q-13 (live valuation of
two holdings where one listing's quote fails: the failing row is left unvalued carrying
`price_unavailable` while the other still values, converts at the quote-month rate and flags
`fx_provisional` when it falls back), and Q-15 (a rename leaves the stored `performance` snapshot's
`ticker` label untouched and unstaled, and regeneration picks the new one up — the documented
display-only drift). A fourth, Q-14 — the price provider serves a split-adjusted history, so every
valuation of a pre-split date was out by the split ratio — is closed in the archive. **One** of those
findings is open below, alongside the audit-trail question that closing a fifth (Q-05/Q-08) raised.

## `exchange_holidays` is a user-editable table that changes a reported figure, but is not audited

Raised 2026-08-20 while closing SCENARIOS Q-05/Q-08, which falsified the ground the exclusion rested
on. `docs/SCHEMA.md` excluded `exchanges` and `exchange_holidays` from the audit trail as "tables
that only influence values persisted onto trades at write time". That is true of `exchanges` (its
`settlement_days` is consumed when a trade is written; `timezone`/`close_time` decide only which
dates are *generable*, never what a stored snapshot says) but not of the holiday calendar:
`reports::valuation::stored_valuations` reads it **live** on every snapshot generation, which is why
migration 0033 had to give it staleness triggers.

The audited set's stated criterion (scope decision 2026-07-14) is "every user-entered table whose
values feed a calculation". `exchange_holidays` now visibly meets it, and this is the same shape as
the two tables that already joined on a falsified premise: `closing_prices` in 0021 (once 0020 made
a price hand-enterable) and `rba_fx_rates` in 0031 (once `PUT /rba_fx_rates/:id` made a rate
correctable). Both were "reference data" until a write path existed; this one has had `PUT`/`DELETE`
from the start.

- [ ] Decide whether `exchange_holidays` joins the audited set, and implement it if so. The case
  for: it is hand-editable, there is no import to re-derive it from (the seed is a one-off in
  0001_schema.sql), a deleted holiday is otherwise unrecoverable, and a wrong holiday silently
  changes both recomputed settlement dates and every snapshot valuation from that date. The case
  against: it is a published exchange calendar rather than a taxpayer fact, and the 0033 staleness
  triggers already surface the *effect* of a change on the reports even though they do not retain
  what was changed. `exchanges` should be decided in the same pass (probably staying out, per the
  reasoning above).
- [ ] If audited, it is the four-place change the rule names: a `row_history` rebuild to extend the
  `table_name` CHECK (the rename pattern of 0018/0021/0027/0031, `PRAGMA legacy_alter_table = ON`),
  the `exchange_holidays_row_history_update`/`_delete` trigger pair, an entry in
  `reports::row_history::AUDITED_TABLES`, and one in `config.js`'s table picker — three of which a
  test pins together. Note the composite `(mic, holiday_date)` key: `row_history.row_id` is an
  INTEGER, so the table would need the same AUTOINCREMENT surrogate id `closing_prices` was rebuilt
  with in 0021 (keeping the natural key as a `UNIQUE`), which makes this the larger of the two
  precedents, not the smaller.

## SCENARIOS Q-02: a still-held delisted or suspended listing blocks the whole portfolio's snapshots indefinitely, undocumented

A listing whose provider serves nothing after its last trading day stores an errored row for every
subsequent trading day, and `stored_valuations` fails the **whole** date if any held listing is
unpriced — deliberately, the no-partial-result rule. So one suspended holding stops
`report-snapshot` for the entire portfolio, every day, and `GET /reports/health` nags with a growing
`errored_days` count.

Reproduced: `POST /closing_prices/backfill` for a delisted US ticker (`ATVI`, 2024-06-05..07) stores
three errored rows (`yahoo fetch for ATVI failed: Not found`), and a held listing in that state
blocks `POST /report_snapshots/generate` for every date.

The system fails safe and the way out exists — the manual price, whose own `reason` placeholder in
`app.js` is literally "provider serves no candle since the delisting". But:

- [ ] That way out is **one hand-entered price per listing per trading day, forever**, for a
  suspension that can run for years, and nothing says so. There is no listing-level "no longer
  priced" fact (only `WorthlessShares`, which ends the holding — wrong for a suspended-but-valuable
  security), and `DELETE /closing_prices/:listing_id/:price_date` explicitly does *not* unblock the
  date, only the health alarm.
- [ ] Not in the Known limitations, and not in the [Closing prices](docs/API.md#closing-prices)
  section, which describes hand-pricing as the answer to "a day the provider can never serve" —
  singular — without saying what an unbounded run of such days costs.

**Fix — Evan chose 2026-08-20: a per-listing dated "unpriced from" fact** (over documenting the cost
alone, and over silently carrying the last stored close forward for *any* unpriced day, which would
weaken the no-partial-result rule everywhere rather than at the one listing that needs it). The
listing records the date from which the provider serves nothing: collection stops fetching it,
`GET /reports/health` stops nagging, and valuation stops blocking the whole date on it — carrying
the last stored close forward and flagging the snapshot, the way the provisional-FX fallback already
works, so the substitution is never silent. Migration + listing field + collection/valuation/health
branches + `docs/API.md`, `docs/SCHEMA.md` and README.
