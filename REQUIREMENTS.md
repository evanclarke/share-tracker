# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive share tracker, where facts about the investing activity are recorded
and an overview of the portfolio can be materialised for given market prices from these facts.  Reporting
and cost basis calculations are done with the Australian tax view in mind.

# Status

Everything specified here through 2026-06-07 is implemented (or explicitly resolved out of scope) and
is documented in `README.md`: the Features, Database schema, and HTTP API sections describe the
implemented behaviour, and the Known limitations section records the resolved out-of-scope decisions
(taxpayer entity type, cost-base elements 3–5 / reduced cost base, taxpayer-level accounts, DRP partial
participation, ESS income). The full historical requirement text and each item's resolution are
preserved in git history and in `TODO.md`'s entries. Ongoing engineering rules (Decimal-only money,
non-destructive migrations, enum constraints, write-time invariants, …) live in `CLAUDE.md`.

# New Requirements

New requirements are written below and then folded into `TODO.md`.
